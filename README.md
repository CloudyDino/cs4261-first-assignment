## Contribute
1. Clone the project with `git@github.com:CloudyDino/cs4261-first-assignment.git`.
2. Open up the Android code in Android Studio by importing the `android` folder in the root directory. To make it work, you'll have to reach out to one of the current contributors to get access to the Firebase console so you can download the config file and add your your SHA certificate fingerprint.
3. You can edit the Firebase functions or the realtime database access rules by opening up the `firebase` folder in the root directory in your favorite code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
